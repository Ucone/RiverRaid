(split over two instances of image?)

left: Yes, general!
right: <playername>, you're our best pilot. Our neighbors, <countryname>, are amassing military forces across the border canyon.

Our only hope is preemptive strike against them. You will pilot an experimental prototype jet, destroying all bridges...

left: It's easy to shoot a bridge sir! It doesn't move! It also doesn't shoot back, sir!

right: Not so fast, hotshot. Enemy will protect the assets with their local numerous forces, and also you'll need to fly low to avoid AAA.

left: Did anybody try this experimental jet yet?

right: No, we can't risk warning the enemy. You're our best hope

left: Yes sir, ready to serve!
